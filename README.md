# Auth API with Express.js & Redis

## Description

This project is an **Authentication API** built with **Express.js**. It leverages **Redis** for session management, ensuring fast and scalable user authentication. Redis is used to store session data and authentication tokens, providing an efficient mechanism to handle user sessions and improve the overall performance of the API.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Sign up, login, and logout functionality.
- **Session Management:** Using Redis to store session data and authentication tokens for performance optimization.
- **JWT Integration:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless authentication.
- **Fast and Scalable:** Redis for quick in-memory data storage and retrieval.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** Redis (for session storage)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
- **Redis** (locally installed or use a Redis cloud service like RedisLabs)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auth-api-express-redis.git
   cd auth-api-express-redis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Redis**:
   Make sure your Redis server is running locally or use a Redis cloud service. For a local instance, you can start Redis with the following command:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

4. **Set environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and configure the following environment variables:
   
   ```
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password (if applicable)
   ```

5. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Available Endpoints

1. **POST /register**
   - Register a new user.
   - Request body:
     ```json
     {
       "username": "string",
       "email": "string",
       "password": "string"
     }
     ```

2. **POST /login**
   - Login a user and issue a JWT.
   - Request body:
     ```json
     {
       "email": "string",
       "password": "string"
     }
     ```
   
3. **POST /logout**
   - Log the user out and delete their session from Redis.

4. **GET /profile**
   - Retrieve the user's profile. Requires JWT authentication.

## Redis Integration

### Why Redis?

Redis is an **in-memory data store** often used for caching and session management in web applications. It stores data in RAM, which makes it faster than traditional databases, making it ideal for managing user sessions and tokens.

### How Redis is Used in This Project

- **Session Storage:** Redis stores session data and authentication tokens, allowing for fast access and management.
- **Efficient Session Expiry:** Redis supports automatic session expiration, which is essential for handling user logins and ensuring that sessions are automatically cleaned up after a period of inactivity.
- **Scalable:** Redis helps in handling large amounts of concurrent users, improving the overall scalability of the application.

### Session Management Flow

1. When a user logs in, their session is created and stored in Redis.
2. The session ID or authentication token is sent back to the client.
3. The client includes this session ID in subsequent requests, which is validated against Redis.
4. When the user logs out, their session is removed from Redis.

### Redis Store Configuration

To use Redis as the session store, the `connect-redis` library is used along with **express-session**. The session store is configured as follows:

```js
const session = require('express-session');
const RedisStore = require('connect-redis')(session);

app.use(session({
  store: new RedisStore({ client: redisClient }),
  secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: { secure: false, httpOnly: true, maxAge: 3600000 } // 1 hour
}));
```

### Redis Client

The Redis client is configured with the following code:

```js
const redis = require('redis');
const redisClient = redis.createClient({
  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
  port: process.env.REDIS_PORT,
  password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD // Optional, if password is set
});

redisClient.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to Redis');
});
```
